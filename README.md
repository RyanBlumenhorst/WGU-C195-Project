How to use:

Program opens to the log in screen. Enter your user name and password.
If it was entered correctly, you will be brought to the main screen that
will show customer information(on the left) and appointments(on the right).
When you click on Manage Customers, you will see more detailed information
on customers and will be able to add/update/delete customers from the list.
When you click on Manage Appointments, you will see more detailed information
on appointments that have been scheduled. You will be able to add/update/delete
appointments from the list.
When you click on Reports you will have three options to choose from (total
customer appointments by type and month, schedule for each contact, and
all appointments for a specified customer)

When you are finished, you click on log out on the main screen and it will
disconnect you with the database.


Unfortunately, I no longer have access to the database, so you can't run this program
anymore without the connection.
